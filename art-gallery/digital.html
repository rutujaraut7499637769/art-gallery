    <p><i>Digital art history can refer to two distinct fields: the history of digital art as an 
        art form, or the field of digital art history, which uses digital tools to study art history
        . The history of digital art begins with early electronic experiments in the 1950s and 60s, 
        evolving through pioneers like Ivan Sutherland with his Sketchpad program and Harold Cohen's
         AARON program, and accelerating with the advent of software like Adobe Illustrator and the
          growth of internet art</i></p>

                <b><i>A "digital sunset" is the practice of intentionally powering down electronic devices at a set
                     time in the evening to disconnect from technology and prepare for rest. This creates a tech-free
                      wind-down routine that reduces blue light exposure and mental stimulation, allowing the brain to relax 
                      and produce melatonin, leading to better sleep. The term is inspired by the natural sunset, signaling the
                       end of the day, and helps establish boundaries between work and personal lif</i></b><br>

                <b><i>New mountain drawing 🏔️ Swipe for the process! This took ...Mountain digital art involves creating images of mountains using digital tools,
                     often focusing on techniques like using basic shapes to build a structure, understanding light and shadow for realism, and using specific software
                      brushes and palettes to achieve different effects like realism or a stylized look. Techniques include building natural-looking shapes by layering and offsetting peaks,
                       painting realistic lighting by first blocking out shadows, and using specialized digital brushes for elements like clouds and textures. Digital art can also be computer-generated or
                        photorealistic, depending on the artist's approach</i></b><br>

                <b><i>"Starry Night" digital art information refers to the digital versions and reproductions of Vincent van Gogh's 1889 oil painting, The Starry Night, which
                     is now in the public domain and can be found in digital archives like the Google Art Project. Digital art
                      inspired by Van Gogh's work often involves using software like Procreate to recreate the swirling sky, 
                      glowing stars, and flame-like cypress trees with digital brushes and layers. The original painting is a Post-Impressionist
